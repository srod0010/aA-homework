pry

- require './filename.rb'  #path
- Play.all
- ORM - lets us interact with database without having to wrtie SQL code
- ex. salesman = Play.new("title" => 'death of a salesman', "year" => 1948, playwright_id => 1)
- salesman.create #adds it to our database
- Play.all => return salesman you just added

Update an entry
- salesman.year = 1949
- * changed instance but has not yet updated
- salesman.update => updates in database
